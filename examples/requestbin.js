 * > Note: Auth0 provides [native mechanisms for debugging rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current#how-to-debug-rules). Should you still desire to send internal rule variables to a third-party service, you should deactivate this rule or comment out the code once you are finished troubleshooting.
